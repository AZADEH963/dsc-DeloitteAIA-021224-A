# dsc-Deloitte-07242📉📊📈 - SQL queries

This repository contains material describing SQLite and SQL SELECT syntax and discusses the structure of relational databases. It also discusses pandas code we can use to interface with SQL databases. 

This repository was fetched from the stacks of a library half inundated in sand and of a desert and forgotten in deep time. There were marine fossils studded in the adjacent dunes suggesting it was, at some point, also the site of an ancient ocean. Whoa. It was sourced and brought to you with ❤️ by Flatiron School
